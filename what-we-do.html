                <p>
                    One of the beautiful dreams for everyone is owning their dream house, but it is near to impossible for most of us to buy our expensive dream house even it is impossible to buy only
                    a small share of it. And also, it is currently impossible to invest our pocket money in real estate market. This is the first problem we are going to solve it in Kryptohus which
                    will help us to buy our dream house block by block.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For most of us, it is hard to buy a normal house without using house-loan. Based on “Statistisk Sentralbyrå” (SSB), 64% of the Norwegian people who buy a house in 2018 are used
                    house-loan whose requirement is having equity at least equal to 15% of the total building price. Saving this money normally takes several years while during this period, the price
                    of houses goes up (figure 1), but the value of our deposits in normal accounts goes down due to inflation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The solution is investing our money in a saving account or stock exchange market while both has their own problems and limitations. The main problem with saving account is its low
                    benefits compare to the real estate market which is illustrated in figure 2

                    The main problem for investing in stock exchange market is related to complexity of the market analyzing to choose a profitable stock for investment and only the expert people will
                    gain from this market. Therefore, either we have to have enough knowledge of this market or consult with financial companies and we have to pay our time or consultancy fee (or part
                    of our benefit will get from our investment). There is no risk with investing in saving accounts but as mentioned their benefit is very low, but stock exchange market is more
                    profitable however it is a risky method for investing. Even if we consult with experts, still there is risk with this market and it is possible to loose our money. Additionally,
                    there are some limitations with both methods for investing such as:

                <h5>Our Solution: New method for selling property by using blockchain technology</h5>
                <p>
                    We want to develop new method for selling property to overcome the limitations and problems existing in the traditional real estates, saving accounts and stock exchange market as
                    mentioned. Our Idea is developing a platform, called Kryptohus, by using blockchain technology to present next generation of digitalized real estate. It will connect three groups
                    with each other: buyers or users, house owners and construction companies which have presale-plan. Instead of selling the ownership of property directly to the market like the
                    current real estates, we tokenize the value of property and sell the tokens to the users who are interested to invest their pocket money in real estate market.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When we sell the tokens which are produced for a specific property, buyers will own the value of the property as many as tokens he/she already bought, and the owner will receive
                    the money as much as the price of property and the property delivered to Kryptohus. If you want to get 100% of the ownership for a specific property and get a key, you just need to
                    collect the number of tokens produced for the property and deliver to Kryptohus. The number of tokens produced for each property will be illustrated in our website (please take a
                    look on our demo page).
                </p>

                    Our tokens, called “Norwegian Property Tokens or NPT”, are utility tokens and play a rule as a digital stock for the property. Therefore, the number of tokens you bought shows your
                    share of the property. In other words, the Norwegian property will be collateral for our tokens and guarantees the value of our tokens. Consequently, while the real estate market
                    is growing, the value of our tokens also will be increasing as much as the market growth. Selling New Property in our system, called SNP, will be done during the following steps:
                </p>
                <ol style="direction: rtl">
                    <li>
                        We tokenize the value of the property based on the current value of our tokens. In this step:
                        <ul>
                            <li>a smart contract will be generated for owner</li>
                            <li>new tokens will be generated and transferred to owner</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The new tokens will be sold to the users by owner in our platform. In this step
                        <ul>
                            <li>a smart contract will be generated for owner</li>
                            <li>new tokens will be generated and transferred to owner</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Kryptohus will get the ownership of the property
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Kryptohus will lease the property and its benefits will be used for covering its expenses and the remaining will be divided between tokens holders.

                <p>
                    Kryptohus design a system called Push&Pump system to reduce the effect of real estate market risk. In this system, when the market drop down, we buy the tokens from market to
                    prevent reducing the token’s price. In other way, when the price of tokens start to goes up un-normally (for example for the increasing the demand for buying tokens) we inject the
                    purchased tokens to the market to have more stable market and reduce the market risk.

                    <li>
                        Online Market: Kryptohus will develop an online market for its users to be able to deal their tokens between each other in their own demand price. Everybody can buy, sell or
                        transfer our tokens very easy, fast and secure by using our mobile-app.

                    <li>
                        Online Shopping: Kryptohus will try to make a contract with companies who have online shopping to accept our tokens. Therefore, our users will be able to pay their invoices
                        directly by NPT tokens or use our tokens during their online shopping.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        NPT Token as a Bonus: Most of the companies give bonus to their customers or their royalty club’s members. Normally, this bonus can be used to buy goods or services from the
                        original company or a limited number of companies who are in a group. If NPT tokens are used as a bonus, the customers can spend their bonus in others companies to buy their
                        needs. Kryptohus will make contract with more and more companies to accept using our tokens as bonus.

                    <li>
                        P2P Lending: One of our future services in Kryptohus will be a P2P lending system to cover small loan and all users can contribute with. In this system, all users can lend
                        their tokens to borrowers based on a smart contract and receive benefit according to the agreed interest. In this system, other companies like banks (as investors), financial
                        companies (as investors), credit scoring companies (risk evaluating) and insurance companies (Insurer) can contribute by investing, insuring, and taking the risks and receive
                        their own benefits from this system. Borrower can payback fit to his/her budget and agreed interest which is the benefit for lenders, insurer and any parties that contribute
                        with this process.

                    How we calculate the price of tokens?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    The price of our tokens calculated as follow:
                </p>
                <p class="text-center">
                    Token Price = (Total price of all tokenized property)/(Total number of produced tokens)
                </p>
                <p>
                    When we tokenize a new property, we calculate the number of tokens we should generate based on the current price of our tokens as follow:
                </p>
                <p class="text-center">
                    Number of tokens for new property = (Current price of property)/(current price of token)
                </p>

                    Our value for house owners and construction companies

                <p>
                    Our commission for house owners is one of our winning cards in real estate market. It is close to zero to sell a property in our platform due to using new technology. It will be
                    negligible and exciting compare to traditional real estate.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our second core value for house owners is feasibility of selling only part of the property which is not possible todays without using our platform. Consider that you as an owner
                    need budget to finance your own small project or increase the liquidity of your company for limited period. Instead of using high interest loan from bank, you can sell only part of
                    your property (e.g. 10%) and receive the budget or liquidity you need. We can tokenize any percentage of your property you want, then you can sell the tokens in the market and
                    receive the money. Later on, when you get money back again, you can go to the market and buyback your tokens again and get the 100% of the ownership.

                <p>
                    One of the benefit of using blockchain technology is the data integrity and all information and transaction recorded securely in a distributed database. Using strong cryptography
                    algorithms and protocols such as digital signature, hash function, asymmetric cryptography ( private/public key cryptography) make it a strong secure system.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our platform build by using blockchain technology to provide the security and data integrity in our ecosystem. Our tokens and all transactions stored in the blockchain and only the
                    owner of tokens can transfer them to other. While the token owners keep their private key secret, nobody can steal or destroy their assets.
